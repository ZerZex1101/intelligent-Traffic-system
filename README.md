The project showcases the development of an Intelligent Traffic Simulation and Monitoring System utilizing real-time data analysis and visualization techniques. The system is designed to simulate traffic conditions and monitor the speed variations of three cars, along with generating insights for effective traffic management.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The system required for Intelligent Traffic Simulation System would depend on the specific needs and goals of the project. However, some of the common requirements include, ● It should run on every standard pc currently in use. • Required Python software to be installed along with the below-mentioned libraries. ● Windows 7, windows 8, windows, Linux and Mac compatible. ● There should be internet connectivity 3G/4G/5G. ● Text or HTML editor such as Notepad in Windows 10. ● Web Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Edge.

BRIEF: The provided code implements an intelligent traffic information system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). It stimulates the communication between cars and updates an Excel file with real-time data, including car speeds, status (red or green signal), and average speed. The implementation incorporates the usage of libraries such as random, time, datetime, openpyxl, and matplotlib.pyplot to generate random car speeds, track time, handle Excel file operations, and visualize the speed variations through line graphs. It's important to note that the implementation does not incorporate a complete IoT infrastructure, such as actual car sensors or network communication. Rather, it serves as a simplified simulation to demonstrate the concept of an intelligent traffic information system. Overall, the provided code offers a foundation for building more sophisticated IoT-based traffic monitoring and management systems. It can be extended and customized to suit specific requirements, enabling the analysis of traffic data for improved decision-making and optimization of transportation networks.

Libraries used: • random2 1.0.1 • Time Module (built-in Python module) • Datetime (Built-in Python module) • Openpyxl 3.0.7 • Matplotlib 3.4.3
